// Operators and Operands example: a + b (a and b are operands and + is operator), There are 5 types of operators in Go language: comparison, arithmetic, logical, bitwise, and assignment.
// Comparison operators:  Used to compare two values. The result of the comparison is a boolean value, either true or false. Allows values of the same type to be compared. == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), and <= (less than or equal to).
// Arithmetic operators: Used to perform mathematical operations. Go supports the following arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, ++, and --.
// Logical operators: Used to combine two or more conditions. Go supports the following logical operators: &&, ||, and !.
// Bitwise operators: Used to perform bitwise operations. Go supports the following bitwise operators: &, |, ^, <<, and >>.
// Assignment operators: Used to assign values to variables. Go supports the following assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, <<=, >>=, &=, |=, and ^=.
// The following example demonstrates the use of the comparison operator

// equal to (==) operator example
/*
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
	var city string = "Oakland"
	fmt.Println(city == city_2)
 }


//less than (<), less than or equal to (<=), greater than (>), and greater than or equal to (>=) operators example

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a, b int = 5, 10
	fmt.Println(a < b)

}

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var a, b int = 10, 10
	fmt.Println(a <= b)

}
