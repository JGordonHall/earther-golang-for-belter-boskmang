// Description: This is a example of Bitwise Operators in Golang. Here we are using AND (&) Bitwise operator. This operator takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1. If either of the bits is 0, the result is 0.

/*package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
	var x, y int = 12, 25
	z := x & y
	fmt.Println(z)
}
Output: 8  This is the output of the code snippet

// Description: This is a example of Bitwise Operators in Golang. Here we are using OR (|) Bitwise operator. This operator takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if either of the bits is 1. If both bits are 0, the result is 0.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var x, y int = 12, 25
	z := x | y
	fmt.Println(z)
}

// Output: 29  This is the output of the code snippet

// Description: This is a example of Bitwise Operators in Golang. Here we are using XOR (^) Bitwise operator. This operator takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the bits are different. If both bits are the same, the result is 0.

package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
    var x, y int = 12 , 25
    z := x  ^ y
    fmt.Println(z)
}
// Output: 21  This is the output of the code snippet

// Description: This is a example of Bitwise Operators in Golang. Here we are using left shift (<<) Bitwise operator. This operator takes two numbers as operands. The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.

package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
	var x int = 212
	z := x << 1
	fmt.Println(z)
}

// Output: 424  This is the output of the code snippet

// Description: This is a example of Bitwise Operators in Golang. Here we are using right shift (>>) Bitwise operator. This operator takes two numbers as operands. The left operands value is moved right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var x int = 212
	z := x >> 2
	fmt.Println(z)
}

// Output: 53  This is the output of the code snippet */
