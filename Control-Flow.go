// Description: This file contains the implementation of the control flow. Control Flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. The control flow of a script is determined by the order in which the statements are written. The control flow of a script can be altered by using control flow statements. Control flow statements are used to alter the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. There are three types of control flow statements in Golang: if, for, and switch. The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. The for statement is used to execute a block of code a specified number of times. The switch statement is used to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable. The control flow statements in Golang are similar to those in other programming languages, such as C and Java. However, Golang has some unique features that make it easier to write and read code. For example, Golang has a built-in error handling mechanism that makes it easy to handle errors in a script. Golang also has a built-in garbage collector that automatically frees up memory when it is no longer needed. Golang is a powerful and flexible programming language that is well-suited for writing scripts that require complex control flow.

// Output: Happy

// Description: This is a example of if-else statement in Golang. The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. The else statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition is false. In this example, we are using the if-else statement to check if the value of the variable "fruit" is "grapes". If the value of the variable "fruit" is "grapes", the code inside the if block is executed. If the value of the variable "fruit" is not "grapes", the code inside the else block is executed.

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var fruit string = "grapes"
	if fruit == "apples" {
		fmt.Println("Fruit is apple")
	} else {
		fmt.Println("Fruit is not apple")
	}
}
// Output: Fruit is not apple

// Description: This is a example of an if-else if-else statement in Golang. The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true. The else statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition is false. The else if statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition is false. In this example, we are using the if-else if-else statement to check if the value of the variable "fruit" is "apples", "grapes", or "oranges". If the value of the variable "fruit" is "apples", the code inside the if block is executed. If the value of the variable "fruit" is "grapes", the code inside the else if block is executed. If the value of the variable "fruit" is "oranges", the code inside the else block is executed.
